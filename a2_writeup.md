# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
Probably just knowing how to figure out percentages, once you explained it to us it made sense but it was difficult because I knew what I had to do but not how to do it. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database by telling it what you're looking for in a certain way that the programming inserted will be able to provide an answer about the movie you are talking about. For example, there can be a list of movies and each movie has multiple actors, so when someone asks for actors from a certain movie, the chatbot can provide it.
